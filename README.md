# Hint
This is only a forked for me and my friends! But you can still use it if you
want.

# Difference to original
The main focus on this plugin is that the plugin places the semicolons (`;`),
commas (`,`) and double points (`:`) **automatically** for you.

# Demo
![Demo](screenshots/short_demo.gif)
I didn't type the semicolon key! Every semicolon is places automatically with
cosco.

# How to use
Please take a look into the `:h cosco` documentation.

# Contributing
Thank you for considering to contribute to this plugin :) Take a look into
[into the documentation](CONTRIBUTING.md) which is extra made if you want to
understand the structure and code of `auto-cosco`.
